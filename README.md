Project Overview: Penetration Testing Toolkit
Objective
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based security testing utility designed to assist in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment.
It allows security testers to identify network weaknesses, simulate brute-force attacks, and improve overall system security.

Key Features
Port Scanning Module

Scans a target IP or domain for open ports.

Detects potential entry points for attackers.

Uses Python’s socket library for reliable scanning.

Brute-Force Simulation Module

Simulates username-password brute force attacks.

Helps identify weak or default credentials.

Can be extended to test FTP, SSH, or web logins.

Modular & Extendable Design

Each module works independently.

Easy to add new modules like subdomain enumeration or directory brute-forcing in the future.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

socket → For network connections and port scanning

itertools → For generating combinations in brute-force attempts

Working Process
User selects module from the menu (Port Scanner / Brute-Force Simulation).

Port Scanner Module:

Takes a target IP or domain.

Scans common TCP ports to identify open services.

Brute-Force Module:

Loads a sample username and password list.

Simulates login attempts until valid credentials are found or the list is exhausted.

Generates a simple report in the terminal showing:

Open Ports

Successful Credential Attempts (if any)

Deliverable
A Python-based Penetration Testing Toolkit capable of:

Detecting open ports on target systems.

Performing basic brute-force simulations for weak authentication detection.

This toolkit provides a foundation for ethical hacking and can be extended to perform comprehensive penetration tests.
